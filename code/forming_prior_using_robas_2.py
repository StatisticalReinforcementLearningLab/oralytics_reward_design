---
We fit our prior parameters in accordance to the procedure in [[Liao et. al., 2015]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439432/#R23) Section 6.3.
1. We use GEE regression anaylsis to fit a model per user to identify significance of each feature.
2. For features that are significant, we set prior mean (mean across users) to be the point estimate from this analysis. Also, prior SD is the empirical SD across participant models (across users) from participant-specific GEE analysis.

  For non-significant features, we set the prior mean to be 0 and the SD is shrunk in half.

$\Sigma_0$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the correspnoding variances for each feature.

Variance estimator for $w^*$:

$(X^\top X)^{-1} (\sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ \sum_{t=1}^T X_{i,t} r_{i,t} \right\}^{\otimes 2} ) (X^\top X)^{-1}$

Note: $(\sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ \sum_{t=1}^T X_{i,t} r_{i,t} \right\}^{\otimes 2} ) \in R^{dxd}$, $\otimes 2$ denotes outer product
